# ü§ìDocker-Py-ReVanced

A little python script that will help you in building [Revanced](https://revanced.app/) [apps](#any-patch-apps) and sharing them anywhere.

**`Note`** - If you are a root user and want magisk module (Extended). Get them [here](https://github.com/nikhilbadyal/revanced-magisk-module)

 <a id="only-builder-support"></a>This is just a builder for revanced and not a revanced support. Please be
 understanding and refrain from asking about revanced features/bugs. Discuss those on proper relevant forums.

## Pre-Built APKs

You can get pre-built apks [here](https://revanced_apkss.t.me/)
